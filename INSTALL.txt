===================================================
 OSGUIsh COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================================


 Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from the Open Scene Graph, OSGUIsh depends only on Boost
(http://www.boost.org). I think so, at least.



 Building
~~~~~~~~~~

OSGUIsh's build system is based on CMake (http://www.cmake.org). The
build process should follow the usual CMake steps:

   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

That said, I recommend to OSGUIsh users to simply add the OSGUIsh
sources to their projects (see below).



 Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSGUIsh is a fairly small library, and one of very limited usefulness
(in the sense that few programs need the functionality it
provides). Therefore, I think that OSGUIsh users should simply add the
OSGUIsh sources to their project.

If you really, really want to install OSGUIsh in a more traditional
way, you are on your own. It shouldn't be hard, though, since OSGUIsh
compiles to a single library, and all public header files are neatly
stored in the same directory.
