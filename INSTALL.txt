 OSGUIsh COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================


 Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apart from the Open Scene Graph, OSGUIsh depends only on Boost
(http://www.boost.org). I think so, at least.


 Building
~~~~~~~~~~
OSGUIsh's official build system is based on SCons
(http://www.scons.org), so, ideally, you should have it (see "I Don't
Have SCons" below if you want alternatives). So, Once you have the
dependencies and SCons installed, just type 'scons' to build
OSGUIsh. You may wish to use the 'mode' option to set the build
mode. For instance, using 'scons mode=opt' you'll make an optimized
build. Use 'scons -h' for help.


 Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use 'scons install'. You'll most likely like to use the 'prefix'
option to configure the installation root directory. In this case, the
installation command would be something like
'scons prefix=/Foo/Bar/OSGUIsh install'.


 I Don't Have SCons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, you should :-)

I may provide alternatives in the future (a Makefile, for instance),
but currently there are no alternatives. Compiling OSGUIsh with your
favorite building system should be easy, though: just compile and
link with all files in the 'Sources' directory.
