OSGUIsh is a library that generates GUI-like events from nodes in an
OSG scene graph. So, a programmer can install callbacks that are
executed when the mouse moves over a node, or when it is clicked, or
double-clicked, or the mouse wheel moves, or... you got the idea.

It still lacks an User's Guide, but I think the demos are simple
enough to show its usage.

Enjoy it, if you can, ;-)
