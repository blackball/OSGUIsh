Simplest:
A quite simple example on how to use OSGUIsh. Has handlers for all
supported events, and jus prints messages in the terminal saying which
events are arriving. Please hit "f" to make the program run in
windowed mode (instead of full-screen) in order to be able to see the
terminal.

ThreeObjects:
Shows three objects. Two of them (the tree and the strawberry) have
events associated to them. Both share the event handlers for
"MouseEnter" and "MouseLeave". They also have handlers for
double-click events (though, these are not shared).

FocusPolicies:
Allows to test the different focus policies for mouse wheel and
keyboard events. Use 'k' to change the keyboard focus policy, and 'm'
to change the mouse wheel focus policy.
