Version 0.3 (02010-05-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~

Essentially, all this release does is to bring OSGUIsh up to date with
OSG. This renewing process caused a few side effects:

- The old "multiple root nodes" feature was replaced with a "multiple
  node masks" feature. It still serves for the same purpose (handling
  HUDs properly), but the means is a little different. (I liked the
  old way better, but I just couldn't make
  osgViewer::View::computeIntersections() work with a NodePath
  parameter, so I adopted this alternative approach.)

- The support for ignoring backfaces when picking works just
  partially. Looks like osgViewer::View::computeIntersections()
  provides less information about the hits than the old
  osgProducer::Viewer::computeIntersections(), so I could only detect
  that a face is back facing if there are at least two hits. This
  *can* be fixed somehow.

As a bonus, I added an example of using a HUD with OSGUIsh.



Version 0.2 (02006-10-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Added a new picking scheme, with multiple "picking roots". Can be
   used to fix problems with picking with multiple 'CameraNodes'.
   That's the case when using HUDs, for example.
 - Added an option to ignore back faces when picking.
 - Event handlers now take all their parameters as a single (struct)
   parameter. This will make the interface a little more stable, at
   least until I decide to make more radical changes to it.
 - Added a quick and dirty Makefile for Linux systems using g++, just
   for convenience. The official build system is still based on
   SCons. This makefile will just compile the library (not the
   demos).
 - Assorted code clean-ups, bug fixes, typo corrections and
   documentation improvements. (But still missing a user's guide.)

Perhaps the two most urgent TODOs are related to documentation:

 - A simple user's guide.
 - A demo showing how to use the "multiple picking roots" to perform
   picking correctly when using a HUD.



Version 0.1 (02006-09-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~

First public release, with an unstable interface and the following
features:

 - Support for the following events: "mouse enter", "mouse leave",
   "mouse move", "mouse down", "mouse up", "click", "double click",
   "mouse wheel up", "mouse wheel down", "key up" and "key down".
 - Support for different policies to determine which node gets mouse
   wheel and keyboard events.
 - Contains three demos, showing how to use it.
 - Has Doxygen documentation. (Still lacks a user's guide).
