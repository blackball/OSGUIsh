Version 0.2 (02006-10-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Added a new picking scheme, with multiple "picking roots". Can be
   used to fix problems with picking with multiple 'CameraNodes'.
   That's the case when using HUDs, for example.
 - Added an option to ignore back faces when picking.
 - Event handlers now take all their parameters as a single (struct)
   parameter. This will make the interface a little more stable, at
   least until I decide to make more radical changes to it.
 - Added a quick and dirty Makefile for Linux systems using g++, just
   for convenience. The official build system is still based on
   SCons. This makefile will just compile the library (not the
   demos).
 - Assorted code clean-ups, bug fixes, typo corrections and
   documentation improvements. (But still missing a user's guide.)
Perhaps the two most urgent TODOs are related to documentation:
 - A simple user's guide.
 - A demo showing how to use the "multiple picking roots" to perform
   picking correctly when using a HUD.

   wheel and keyboard events.
