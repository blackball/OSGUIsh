Simplest:
A quite simple example on how to use OSGUIsh. Has handlers for all
supported events, and just prints messages in the terminal saying
which events are arriving.

ThreeObjects:
Shows three objects. Two of them (the tree and the strawberry) have
events associated to them. Both share the event handlers for
"MouseEnter" and "MouseLeave". They also have handlers for
double-click events (though, these are not shared).

FocusPolicies:
Demonstrates the different focus policies for mouse wheel and keyboard
events. Use 'k' to change the keyboard focus policy, and 'm' to change
the mouse wheel focus policy.

HUD:
Shows how to use the "multiple picking masks" feature to properly use
OSGUIsh with a HUD.

PointsAndLines:
Shows how the "picker radius" parameter can be used to allow getting
events points and lines.
